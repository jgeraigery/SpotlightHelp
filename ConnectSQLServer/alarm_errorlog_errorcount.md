## When the alarm is raised

Look at the SQL Server \| Error Log Drilldown to view the errors.

## Configuration

You can define and edit the alert rules that Spotlight scans the SQL Server Error Log for in the Configure Error Log Entries dialog. For more information, see Configure \| Error Log Entries.
Spotlight scans the error logs at the configured frequency. If you make changes to the alert rules it may take some time for changes to take effect. You can change how often Spotlight scans the error log in the Schedules dialog. For more information, see Configure \| Scheduling.
