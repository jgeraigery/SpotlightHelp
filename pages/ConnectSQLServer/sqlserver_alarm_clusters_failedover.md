Spotlight detects that at some time in the past a cluster node (computer system) stopped running as part of the cluster. The workload that it normally processes was failed over to other servers in the cluster.

This alarm can only be raised when you are connected to a SQL Server that is running as part of a **Microsoft  Cluster Server** (MSCS).
