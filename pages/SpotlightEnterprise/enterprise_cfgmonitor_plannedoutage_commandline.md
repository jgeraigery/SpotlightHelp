## Requirements
Microsoft Windows Powershell 3.0 or above is required. Older operating systems (for example Windows Server 2008 R2) require an upgrade of the Windows Management Framework in order to access Spotlight from the command line. [Download Windows Management Framework 3.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595)

For commands where user / password details are required ensure the user is a member of the [Spotlight Diagnostic User Groups](enterprise_backend_spotlightdiagnosticusergroups) **Spotlight Diagnostic Administrators** or **Spotlight Diagnostic Users**. Where there are multiple Spotlight Diagnostic Servers in a [federation](enterprise_backend_federation) the user is required to be a member of Spotlight Diagnostic Administrators or Spotlight Diagnostic Users for all Spotlight Diagnostic Servers in the federation.

## 1. Access Spotlight from Windows Powershell / the command line

From Windows Powershell, enter command: **Import-DS | Add-DS -PassThru**.

{% include tip.html content="Enter command **get-dS** to verify the Spotlight Diagnostic Server has been imported correctly." %}

{% include tip.html content="In some special situations or for some platforms, if **Import-DS** does not work for you then open the **Console** directory in the Spotlight Client installation directory (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Quest Software\Spotlight Enterprise). Right click the file **ds-cli.cmd** and select **Open** to open the command prompt." %}


## 2. Command Spotlight from Windows Powershell / the command line

* List Spotlight connections
* Add a planned outage scheduled to occur once only
* Add a planned outage scheduled to occur every day
* Add a planned outage scheduled to occur on given days of the week
* Add a planned outage scheduled to occur on the given day of the given months

## Windows Powershell / Command line parameters

### -Address address
The listed connections will be added to the planned outage.

List the connections in the form @{SqlServer="sqlserver1"} where in this example *SqlServer* is the connection type and *sqlserver1* the address of the SQL Server connection.

For multiple connections of the same connection type, separate each address with a comma as in @{SqlServer="sqlserver1,sqlserver2"}

For multiple connections of different connection types, list connections of each type separately as in @{SqlServer="sqlserver1,sqlserver2"; Windows="windows1,windows2"}

The address of the connection can take the same forms as available in the **Spotlight Client \| Configure Connections \| Properties \| Details \| Address field**. For example: the Server Name, Server Instance Name, or IP address.

{% include note.html content="The -Name command line parameter (used to [List / edit / delete Spotlight Connections][enterprise_connect_commandline]) is not available with the Add-Outage command." %}
