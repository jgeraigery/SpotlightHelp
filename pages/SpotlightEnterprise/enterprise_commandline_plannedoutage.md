## Windows Powershell / Command line parameters

### -Address address
List the connections to be added to the planned outage in the form @{SqlServer="sqlserver1"} where in this example *SqlServer* is the connection type and *sqlserver1* the address of the SQL Server connection.

The connection types are (case insensitive):

* sqlserver
* windows
* hyperv
* analysisservices
* availabilitygroup
* replication

For multiple connections of the same connection type, separate each address with a comma as in @{SqlServer="sqlserver1,sqlserver2"}

For multiple connections of different connection types, list connections of each type separately as in @{SqlServer="sqlserver1,sqlserver2"; Windows="windows1,windows2"}

The address of the connection can take the same forms as available in the **Spotlight Client \| Configure Connections \| Properties \| Details \| Address field**. For example: the Server Name, Server Instance Name, or IP address.
